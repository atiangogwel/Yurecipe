The Recipe Sharing Platform aims to revolutionize the culinary experience by providing a dynamic web application tailored to the needs of modern food enthusiasts

Users can browse recipes by category (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts), cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Asian, Mexican), and dietary preferences.
A robust search feature allows users to find recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or specific criteria.
